Hi! I'm a student developer, and this is my latest project. I built this to solve a real-world problem while mastering full-stack development with **React** and **Python**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js, HTML/CSS
* **Backend:** Python FastAPI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git

## 📂 Project Structure

Unlike standard setups, I organized my folders to keep the logic clean:

* **`frontend/`**: Contains the React user interface.
* **`app/`**: Contains the Backend API and server logic.
